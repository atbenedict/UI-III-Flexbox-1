Overall:
Glad to see you’re getting github working. Your CSS and HTML is spot on. Great work.

What looks good:

You got the boxes separated out on the services page nicely.
Good layout.

Suggestions:
1.	Be sure to check the README file for important info before (and during) the coding process – the Nav portion on the main page was not there.
